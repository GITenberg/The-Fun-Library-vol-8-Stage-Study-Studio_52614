<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="largecap fsize90">The life of what still passes in London for “Bohemia”&mdash;in and
about the theatres, the studios and the literary clubs&mdash;figures
conspicuously in the pictorial humour of our time. It is but natural
that the artist in search of inspiration should occasionally turn his
attention to his own immediate surroundings, and find subjects for his
art in the comic representation of his fellows of the brush and pencil,
his friends the authors and the actors, and not infrequently, himself!
Some of the most pointed jokes of Keene, Du Maurier and Phil May
introduced “the artist,” and in the case of the last mentioned he usually
depicted his own form and features, as Cruikshank was fond of doing
more than half a century before him.</p>

<p class="fsize90">This tradition has been well maintained among the artists of a later
day. We shall find that a very considerable proportion of the humorous
art of the moment concerns itself with the sayings and doings of our
Bohemians&mdash;a term, by the way, that indicates a very mild and inoffensive
variety of an almost extinct type of character.</p>

<p class="fsize90">The Bohemian of the twentieth century is a much more wholesome
person than his prototype of the middle of the nineteenth. He may
be still as irresponsible, as unconventional in his manners, but he is at
least clean and less apt to degenerate into the “sponger.” He of the
older generation provided picturesque material for the humorist of<span class="pagenum" id="Pageii">[ii]</span>
the pencil; but the stage, the study, and the studio still furnish much
matter for mirth, as the admirable work of Mr. W. K. Haselden, Mr.
Bert Thomas, Mr. H. M. Bateman, Mr. J. L. C. Booth, Mr. Charles Pears,
and other living artists of note, represented in the present collection,
bear ample witness.</p>

<p class="fsize90">It is obvious from the <a href="#Pageiii">Index</a> that this volume contains a most representative
survey of its subject, and is probably second-to-none in <span class="smcap">The
Fun Library</span> for the high spirits and good humour which it reflects.
The collection ranges from the day of Cruikshank onward, and presents
many examples of such talented artists of the past as Fred Barnard,
Du Maurier, Keene, Leech, Phil May, Doyle, and many others, as well
as examples of Mr. Gordon Thomson, the veteran survivor of the merry
men who made <i>Fun</i> and <i>Judy</i> serious rivals of <i>Punch</i> fifty years ago.</p>

<p class="fsize90">The sources from which the illustrations have been drawn are much
the same as those that have provided the other volumes of <span class="smcap">The Fun
Library</span>. In the present volume there is a particularly fine selection
from the work of Mr. Haselden, reprinted here by special permission
of the editor of <i>The Daily Mirror</i>, and it also contains an important
series by the late Phil May, reprinted by arrangement with <i>The Sketch</i>,
while we are indebted to Mr. Gilbert Dalziel for permission to use a
considerable number of excellent items from <i>Fun</i> and <i>Judy</i>, with which
journals he was so long and honourably associated. To Mr. Punch’s
collections of the “’sixties” we owe the numerous examples of Leech,
Keene and Du Maurier at their best.</p>

<p class="fsize90">In brief, it may be claimed for “Stage, Study and Studio” that the
collection is fully up to the high standard we have sought to maintain
in all the volumes of <span class="smcap">The Fun Library</span>.</p>

<p class="blankabove largecap">Practical joking might correctly be described
as a remnant of the barbaric ages, when
strength and muscle received the respect we now
award to mind and brain. Indeed, it still passes
current among modern barbarians for humour, while in
civilized States, where humour is something that appeals
to the intellect, joking in the practical sort is generally
regarded as buffoonery. Having admitted thus much, it
may be said that even practical joking is not all bad,
and is sometimes “a source of innocent merriment.”</p>

<p class="blankabove largecap">Joking of the practical kind is very often a pronounced
characteristic of the actor, as the countless stories of
players and their pranks abundantly prove. The reason
for this is most likely to be found in the fact that it
requires something of the actor’s talent successfully to
carry out a practical joke, and actors, knowing they
possess the ability, are often tempted to exercise it.
The name of the genial J. L. Toole, of happy memory,
will naturally occur to every one in this connexion, and
the fact of that good-hearted soul having had a strong
weakness for this diversion is ample proof that practical
joking is quite compatible with geniality of character.
The stories that are told of Toole and those which he
told of himself would easily fill a couple of volumes. For
the purpose of the present chapter a typical one will
suffice.</p>

<p class="blankabove largecap">The comedian once entered a
dairy, and solemnly remarked
to the shopman&mdash;“I will take a
boy,” with a glance at his shelves.
“A boy, sir?” asked the puzzled
shopman. “Yes, or a girl,” replied
the comedian. The man
never doubted but his visitor was
a lunatic, and said, mildly&mdash;“Pardon
me, this is a milkshop.”
“Come outside,” said Toole,
and taking the dairyman by the
arm he led him out of the shop
and pointed to the sign. “I’ll
take a boy or a girl,” he solemnly
repeated. “Read what your notice
states&mdash;‘Families supplied in any
quantity.’”</p>

<p class="blankabove largecap">E. A. Sothern, the famous
“Lord Dundreary,” had an
insatiable propensity for practical
joking, and many are the stories of his pranks. One of the most
amusing, though, perhaps, a little cruel, tells of his treatment of his
guests on the occasion of a dinner party to a number of congenial souls.
They were all assembled but one, who was rather late. After waiting
a few minutes, the host suddenly exclaimed&mdash;“Here he comes&mdash;let’s
all get under the table&mdash;make haste.” Anticipating a joke, they all
scrambled under, except Sothern himself. Enter guest&mdash;“Hallo!
where are all the other fellows?” “Oh, they all got under the table<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
when they heard you coming. I’m sure, I don’t know why.” The
ignominous crawling forth one by one that ensued can safely be left to
the imagination of the reader.</p>

<p class="largecap">It is always a good thing when we find the subject of a practical joke
joining good-naturedly in the mirth, and this we have in a story told
by the late Mr. G. A. Sala of a joke played upon him by Lord Dundreary.
“I remember going down to the Derby,” writes the famous journalist,
“in a highly festive fashion, with poor Edward Sothern, the never-to-be
forgotten Lord Dundreary. On this particular day Sothern, the kindest,
but still the most provoking of practical jokers, was as full of mischievous
pranks as an egg is full of meat. He offered to bet me a guinea before
we reached Clapham that I would lose my temper, and lose it badly,
before 2 p.m. ‘But why, my dear Sothern,’ I asked, ‘should I lose it?
The weather is beautiful, I did my work by getting up at six this morning,
I am in the best of all good company, and I haven’t got a penny on the
race.’ ‘Never mind,’ persisted Lord Dundreary, ‘I will bet you one guinea
that you will blaze up like a vesuvian thrown into the fire before 2 p.m.’</p>

<p class="fig027"><span class="noshow">&#8220;I</span>t was half-past one when we reached the course, and one of the
officious red-jackets who haunt the Hill stepped forward
and gave me the customary brush down. I strolled a
few paces onward, when another red-jacket pounced
down on me, and, notwithstanding my expostulations,
brushed me down again, hissing meanwhile as though he
were grooming a horse. I essayed to light a cigar, when a
third brush-fiend was upon me; but when a fourth made his appearance,
brandishing his implement of torture, the dams of my long pent-up
temper broke down, and a torrent of adjectives, the reverse of
complimentary, flowed over the fourth brush-demon. My wrath was
at its height when I found myself quickly tapped on the shoulder, and
beheld the maliciously chuckling countenance of Sothern. ‘I will
trouble you for one guinea,’ he said, and proceeded to explode with
laughter. Of course he had followed me about, and feed the brush-fiends
to harry me to desperation.”</p>

<p class="largecap">W. J. Florence, a well-known American comedian in his day, was
very much on a par with Sothern in the matter of practical joking,
and the story of a good-natured trick he played on the latter, as related
by himself in one of his posthumous papers, is very entertaining. “Meeting
Sothern on Broadway one fine morning,” so the story goes, “I told him
that there was an oat for him at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, taking care to
pronounce my words in such a careless, inarticulate way that the genial
comedian thought I said there was a note for him at the hostelry I had
named. He accordingly started off post-haste up town&mdash;we had met near
the battery, whither we both had strolled for a morning constitutional&mdash;to
get his oat. When he reached the Fifth Avenue Hotel and the clerk, in
response to his inquiry, handed him out the grain of oats which I had
left for him, he saw the joke immediately, and laughed at it most heartily,
devoting the remainder of the day to telling everybody he met what a
capital joke Florence had played on him.”</p>

<p class="largecap">The late Fred Leslie was another popular comic actor who, like
Sothern and Toole and so many of “the profession” past and
present, was never so happy as when planning some harmless practical
joke, which was always sure to amuse every one concerned. One of his
most successful efforts in this direction was made during his tour in America
with the Gaiety Company, and is related by the late Clement Scott in his
recollections of this celebrated comedian.</p>

<p class="blankabove fig031"><span class="hide">O</span>ne night (says Mr. Scott) several of his <i>confrères</i>
had been invited to a supper, and the number included
the musical director of the theatre they
were then playing at. His absence from the
orchestra nearly the entire evening in question
was generally commented on, and it subsequently
leaked out that he had been busily employed
composing the music of a song which he intended
to submit to them for approval before the party
broke up. The night being a fine one, it was agreed
to walk from the theatre to the house of their host.
The composer, when he sallied from the stage
door, was seen to have a huge roll of music, carefully
tied up, peeping from one of his overcoat
pockets. This was just as carefully abstracted,
and some one was deputed to stroll leisurely onward
and engage the victim in apparently earnest
conversation, while the rest remained behind and
committed the music to memory, after which the
manuscript was skilfully returned without arousing
the slightest suspicion.</p>

<p class="largecap">At the termination of the meal, and before the
musician could reach the piano, Leslie began
to whistle a few bars of the melody, which, it is
scarcely necessary to add, attracted universal
attention. When pressed to continue, Leslie gave
the air from beginning to end, and when, at the
conclusion, he remarked that it was an old English
ballad, cold beads of perspiration gathered on
the forehead of the unhappy composer. His solemn
asseveration that he had that evening written an original melody to the
same air, note for note, was received on every hand with apparent
unbelief; and in order to verify Leslie’s statement, most of those present
followed his lead and sang or whistled the composition through. The
musician, we are told, was allowed to play it over, and the resemblance,
of course, was so striking that he himself began to doubt his own sanity.
But when he came to know of the trick by which he had been bamboozled,
he enjoyed the joke as much as those who carried it out.</p>

<h3>HUMOURS OF THE PLAYHOUSE</h3>

<div class="highlines">

<p class="largecap blankabove">The function of the stage is a much discussed
question. We shall assume that it is first and
foremost a place of entertainment. Many are the
comedies, from Shakespeare’s to Shaw’s, that have
tickled the ribs of the “groundlings,” but there is also
about stage performances a frequent element of diversion
supplied by effects entirely unrehearsed. In most cases
these “unrehearsed effects” assume the form of amusing
blunders, in others they may be witty impromptus on
the part of an actor or an auditor, “gags,” “wheezes,” what not!
A laughable mistake has often afforded relief to a dull play; while, on the
other hand, it may have been the means of spoiling an otherwise effective
scene.</p>

<p class="largecap">A curious thing about stage blunders is that, when one of the characters
makes a mistake it is almost a certainty that some other
member or members of the cast will follow suit. It is related of Charles
Matthews, the famous comedian, that if he made one mistake in the
course of a performance he was sure to commit several blunders
before the conclusion of the play; this, no doubt, arising from over-anxiety
to guard against slips. On one occasion he informed an astonished
audience that he saw “a candle going along a gallery with a man in
its hand,” and later in the play he stated that he had “locked the key
and put the door in his pocket.”</p>

<p class="largecap">John Kemble, according to an anecdote told of him in Tom Moore’s
<i>Diary</i>, once made a very ludicrous mistake. He was performing
one of his most famous parts at some country theatre, and, as is common
in some provincial temples of the Drama, a child had been making its
presence very pronounced by emitting the shrill noises peculiar to the
average infant. At last Kemble could bear the infantine interruptions
no longer, and advancing to the front of the stage he assumed his most
tragic air and said&mdash;“Ladies and gentlemen, unless the play is stopped,
the child cannot possibly go on.” Kemble’s audience on that occasion
was not like the one in San Francisco in its early days. An opera company
was performing in the rowdy city of the “Pacific Slope,” when a child
in the auditorium created a great disturbance. The burly gold-seekers,
who mainly composed the audience, ordered the players to stop till the
child was finished with its entertainment, as an infant’s voice was
such a rarity in the Wild West at that time that it awakened pleasant
memories of the old home and tugged at the heart-strings of the rough-and-ready
miners. This is a genuine instance of the play being stopped
and “the child going on.”</p>

<p class="largecap">A very amusing mistake is laid to the credit of Quin. On one occasion,
while he was acting “Judge Balance” in <i>The Recruiting
Officer</i>, he addressed Mrs. Peg Woffington in these <span class="nowrap">terms&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Sylvia, what age were you when your dear mother married?”</p>

<p>Peg made no reply to the embarrassing query, so Quin <span class="nowrap">proceeded&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I ask you what age you were when your mother was born?”</p>

<p>Thus going from bad to worse. The actress fortunately did not lose
her presence of mind, and <span class="nowrap">replied&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I regret I cannot answer your question; but I can tell you how old
I was when my mother <i>died</i>.”</p>

<p class="largecap">Amusement is frequently afforded by some member of the audience
losing himself in the play, and fancying that the scene before him
is a page from real life. When such incidents occur, they form excellent
testimonials to the dramatic abilities of the actors. A striking instance
of this kind is related in connexion with the late Fanny Kemble. It
occurred while she was appearing in Philadelphia as “Juliet.” She had

<p class="noindent">when a tall, lanky, medical student in a stage box, who had evidently
been deeply absorbed in the scene, thrust his hat on his head in great
excitement, crying out in a voice that could be heard all over the theatre&mdash;“Keep
him up, Juliet; I’ll run and fetch the stomach pump.”</p>

<p class="largecap">An incident of a similar nature occurred many years ago at the London
Princess Theatre. A well-known conveyancer, noted for absence
of mind, during a performance of <i>Macbeth</i>, one of the witches replying
to the Thane, that they
were “doing a deed without
a name,” started up exclaiming,
to the bewilderment of
the audience&mdash;“A ’deed
without a name’! Why,
it’s void. It’s not worth
sixpence!” The last time
Kean played <i>Louis XI</i> at
the Edinburgh Theatre
Royal, a young Irishman
who had been sitting spellbound
in the stalls, after
the attendants had proclaimed,
“The King is
dead!” exclaimed, “And
may the Lord have mercy
on his guilty soul.”</p>

<p class="largecap">Sometimes a voice from
the “gods” may be
the means of swamping a
play. This was the case
with the only dramatic piece ever written by Miss Braddon, the famous
novelist. In one of the acts a child was kidnapped from its mother, and
at the end, when all the characters in the play were being made happy,
the restoration of the child was taken for granted. This was a dramatic
mistake, and while suited for a novel, was not to be accepted in the
theatre. The omission passed unnoticed for half a minute after the fall
of the curtain; then one of the “gods” leaned over the gallery and
coolly inquired&mdash;“What about the kid?” The piece was doomed in
the uncontrollable peals of laughter that followed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span></p>

<p class="largecap">Instances where
members of a cast,
through ignorance or
forgetfulness, take some
scene or dialogue literally,
are most mirth-moving,
if somewhat rare. A
highly entertaining instance
of this kind occurred
once when John
Kemble was playing
<i>Hamlet</i> in a country
town. An actor, who
was sustaining the part
of “Guilderstein,” was, or
imagined himself to be, a
capable musician. “Hamlet,”
in the usual course
of the play, asked <span class="nowrap">him&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“Will you play upon
this pipe?”</p>

<p>“My Lord, I cannot.”</p>

<p>“I do beseech you.”</p>

<p>“Well, if your lordship insists upon it, I will do as well as I can.”</p>

<p>And to the great consternation of “Hamlet” and the amazement of
the audience, he proceeded to play “God Save the King.”</p>

<p class="largecap">A delightful piece of literalism is told about a property man
who on one occasion was deputizing at a rehearsal of <i>Macbeth</i>
in which a well-known actor was filling the title rôle. Here is a scrap of
the <span class="nowrap">dialogue&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="largecap">To ludicrous instances there is no end; but perhaps one of the most
comical occurred in a wretched little French theatre during the time
of the first Revolution. Madame de Larme, who was playing “Juliet”
on the occasion, was lying in the death scene on a tombstone. Outside,
it was raining in torrents. A drop came through the roof and fell on
“Juliet’s” nose. She made a face. Another drop found its way to
her eyelid. She winked. Finally, she took to watching the drops
and dodging them. The situation was at once appreciated by the
audience, and it sympathized with the actress.</p>

<p>“Look out, Mrs. Juliet,” said one fellow, “there’s a big one coming.
I see it.”</p>

<p>“Mind your eye,” said another.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said a third, rising, “will you accept my umbrella?”</p>

<p>But “Juliet” bore up bravely to the end, and finished the scene
amid the applause of a sympathetic audience.</p>

<p class="largecap">In a Glasgow theatre some forty years ago, the playgoers were treated
to a very diverting scene that was not in the programme. The
play was <i>After Dark</i>, and in one of the acts there is a very exciting
railway scene in which a train crosses the stage just as one of the characters
who has been tied to the rails is released. The manner in which the
train is manipulated is very simple. A number of men, concealed behind
it, run across the stage. On this occasion the man who was working
the engine tripped and fell, carrying the engine with him, when about halfway
across the stage. The man in charge of the tender, not having time
to clear out of the way, fell over the engine-keeper, and the third fell over
him, the curtain being run down on the most exciting railway disaster that
ever occurred in Stageland, the audience laughing heartily the while.</p>

<p class="largecap">At a theatre in Glasgow the writer witnessed a very amusing
incident in the course of a representation of <i>Theodora</i> by Miss
Grace Hawthorne’s Company. There is a tremendously “bluggy”
scene in this drama, which closes with the heroine standing in the
middle, while a collection of corpses strew the stage. On the night
in question the drop curtain refused to perform its office, and after<span class="pagenum" id="Page34">[34]</span>
coming half-way down complacently stuck there. The dead bodies

the Restoration Stage, when players “died” in front of the curtain

from the famous epilogue spoken by Nell Gwynne in Dryden’s <i>Tyrannick
Love</i>. She played a serious part on this occasion, and in the last act
stabs herself twice, and dies. She lies dead on the stage; then, when
the bearer comes to carry her off, she starts to her feet, <span class="nowrap">exclaiming&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="largecap">Stage “waves” have often afforded no
little amusement to the audience. The
troubled ocean is simulated on the stage by
a number of men lying on their backs under a
painted canvas, kicking their legs and throwing
their arms about with a certain amount of
regularity, the men being blindfolded to
prevent the dust getting into their eyes.
During a performance of the <i>Black Flag</i>, at
Dundee, a scene in which the waves were
required was introduced and went with its
usual success till one evening the curtain got
entangled with the sea-cloth, and on the former
being raised it carried the latter with it,
exposing to the view of the audience the
group of wave-makers lying on their backs
vainly kicking the air. The audience, of
course, screamed with laughter, which set the
wave men wondering, and, thinking something
was amiss, they unfastened the bandages
over their eyes and discovered their undignified
positions, quitting the stage with the greatest
rapidity. The audience were not in a mood
for settling down to watch the surging sea
after this, and the remainder of the scene
was omitted from that performance.</p>

<p class="largecap">In this connexion the experience of a well-known
comedian who started his career
as a humble “wave,” will afford the reader
some merriment. He writes:&mdash;“At last the
shipwreck came on, and I was hustled under
the sea-cloth along with a dozen other ‘supes.’
Our business was to make the sea rise in its
might and wreck the gallant ship. We had
been repeatedly cautioned at rehearsal not to
use our hands, but to go down on all
fours and produce the foaming billows
by ‘humping’ our backs up and down.
This was a very trying exercise; it was much easier to use our
hands, though it gave to the rolling billows a jagged and unnatural
appearance, and when the dry white paint sifted freely through the
cloth, covering us up, choking and blinding us as the climax approached,
I commenced in a fit of desperation to use my hands, so as to dodge
the foam as much as possible, and keep it from totally blinding
me. But I was soon perceived by the stage carpenter, who instantly
dived under the cloth, labouring under wild excitement, and commenced
cursing me in dumb show for not ‘humping’ my back as I had been
told to do. He was so fierce that I quickly edged away from him.
This made him worse. He signalled me to come back. I edged away
a little further, and a moment later stood up through a hole in the cloth,
as big as a barn door, in the midst of the angry breakers, and covered from
head to foot with the white powder. There was not a sound in the house
until I gave a terrible ‘chahoo!’ and suddenly dived back under the
waves. Then you could not have heard the report of an eighty-ton
gun a hundred yards away.”</p>

person as well as in style, was drowsing out his dying speech, when a
voice from the gallery exclaimed, “Ah, now, die at once!” to which
another from the opposite side of the house responded, “Hould your
tongue, you blackguard!” then,
in a patronising tone to the
Jaffier, “Take your time now!”</p>

<p class="largecap">There was humour, and what
is often much akin to that,
pathos, in the appeal wrung from
the unlucky representative of
crook-backed Richard, who, finding
it impossible to make head
against the disapprobation evoked
by his histrionic efforts, dropped
blank verse, and in very plain
prose told his audience&mdash;“Mr.
Kean is playing this part in
London at a salary of thirty
pounds a night; I receive but
fifteen shillings a week; and if it
isn’t good enough for the money,
may Heaven give you more
humanity!”</p>

<p class="largecap">At a crowded country theatre
in France a woman fell from
the gallery into the pit, and was
picked up by one of the spectators,
who, hearing her groaning,
asked her if she was much injured.
“Much injured!” exclaimed
the woman; “I should
think I am. I have lost the
best seat in the very middle of the front row.”</p>

<h3>SCENERY AND COSTUME OF THE STAGE</h3>

</div>

<p class="fig065"><span class="hide">W</span>e must assume there is something very
peculiar in the rural landscapes and
the town residences inhabited by the
dramatic population, if the haunts of
their rustics and the dwelling-places of
their citizens are to be judged by the
representations of these places which
we see upon the British stage. The
dramatic idea of the country consists usually of a series of set
pieces, backed by a six-inch deal bridge, surmounting a two-foot
waterfall, and leading to a profile cottage of such diminutive dimensions
that when the feet of any one entering it are on the basement,
his head soars into the second story, and he cannot, without doubling
himself completely up, go either in or out of the door. In some
cases the cottages have no pretension to habitable qualities, but are
simply “made out” of a single piece of canvas, on which a clearly “impracticable”
window is painted, and which the business of the scene
does not require to be opened, the cottage being only needed as the cue
for some song or sentiment, such as “Ah! that humble cot&mdash;how its
aspect makes me sigh for Home, Sweet Home!” or, “The sight of that
lowly roof makes me feel no envy for pampered pride in its palace, or
venal villany in its villa; for I am convinced more and more of the beautiful
truth, that it is in the cottage alone contentment can be found.”</p>

<p>Sometimes there is, by way of background, a castle, frightfully foreshortened,
with its battlements half a yard high, and its towers towering
among the sky-borders, while its foundations rest on a rock no higher
than the top of the low comedian’s hat; but the structure is sufficient
to admit of its being apostrophized by some young gentleman in
hessians and a chocolate surtout as “Deserted halls of my ancestors,
whose pavements have rung to the clang of the usurper’s hoof, and whose
donjon-keep has echoed to the noisy revels of a stranger band.” When
the occasion is an operatic one, the distant castle forms an admirable
subject for something like the <span class="nowrap">following&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Every playgoer is familiar with the “mossy bank” of dramatic
rural scenery, with one end slightly elevated for the head of the weary
wayfarer or benighted traveller, and a bit of an old bolster craftily crammed
underneath the canvas to complete the mossiness of the contrivance.</p>

<p>The town scenery of the stage is not less peculiar than its landscapes,
and the exteriors are particularly adapted for teaching “what to avoid”
to the youthful architect. If young <i>Dashington</i> calls upon <i>Lord Toplofty</i>,
the latter lounges lazily out of the first-floor French window, in which
his head and shoulders are a pretty tight fit, while the former bears about
the same proportion to the house that the peasant bears to the cottage
we have already been speaking of. It is a singular fact that the inside
of any one room is no sooner represented to us, than we find it to be
much larger than the whole house when judged by its external appearance;
and though the mansion itself may be only ten feet high from
the basement to the tip of the topmost chimney-pot, the smallest apartment
is found to be as wide as the wings are apart, and as lofty as the
proscenium.</p>

<p>In costume, the stage presents some really astounding phenomena;

the retainers of every country, every age, and indeed of almost every

the same habiliments being always retained under all circumstances,
whether the wearer happens to be a creature of the house of Hapsburg,
a vassal of a Norman noble, or a member of a bellowing band of Swiss

<p class="fig072"><span class="hide">T</span>he forthcoming show of donkeys promises
to be a great success. The only difficulty
that seems to us likely to embarrass the
manager is the selection of a locality large
enough for the exhibition. If but a tenth
part of the asses in the metropolis make an
exhibition of themselves on this, as they
are apt to do on ordinary occasions,
nothing smaller than the grounds of the
Crystal Palace or the Alexandra Park
could possibly accommodate them.</p>

<p>The following, we believe, are already <span class="nowrap">entered:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>An egregious ass, that believes in the speedy subjugation of the
Confederates by the Federals in America.</p>

<p>An awful donkey, who prefers Tupper to Tennyson.</p>

<p>An old ass, who, by means of false teeth, tight waist, a wig, and rouge,
imagines himself a lady-killer.</p>

<p>A young ass, who, by smoking strong cigars until he is sick, imagines
himself manly.</p>

<p>Several thundering donkeys, who are always sending money anonymously
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for unpaid income-tax.</p>

<p>A still larger number of even more hopeless asses, who patronize
quack-doctors, cheap, puffing tailors, delineators of character by handwriting,
and other advertising swindles.</p>

<p>An irreclaimable ass (supposed to be the only one living), who does
not see any merit in <span class="smcap">Fun</span>. The greatest ass alive.</p>

<p>There are several others we could mention, but the astounding
asinine qualities of the last-named donkey have quite taken away our
breath. In the forthcoming “competitive examination, of donkeys,”
let him by all means bear away the prize!

<p class="largecap">Addison in his <i>Papers on Wit</i> makes vigorous onslaught
against “false wit.” “The first species of
false wit which I have met with is venerable for its
antiquity, and has produced several pieces which have
lived very near as long as the <i>Iliad</i> itself; I mean those
short poems printed among the minor Greek poets, which
resemble the figure of an egg, a pair of wings, an axe, a
shepherd’s pipe, and an altar.”</p>

<p class="largecap">Further on, he says, referring to these conceits, “the poetry was
to contract or dilate itself according to the mould in which it was
cast. In a word, the verses were to be cramped or extended to the dimensions
of the frame that was prepared for them, and to undergo the fate
of those persons whom the tyrant Procustes used to lodge in his iron bed;
if they were too short he stretched them on a rack; and if they were too
long he chopped off a part of their legs, till they fitted the couch which he
had prepared for them.”</p>

<p class="largecap">Most people accept this dictum of Addison as a final pronouncement
on the distinction between true and false wit; but on further
consideration it may be found that “much can be said on the other side.”
Addison asserts that the matter must suffer if it has to be squeezed into
a certain shape. This may be so, but it need not be much more so in the
forming of a pair of wings in verse, than in the construction of a sonnet.
Every sonnet, no matter how inspired, must follow an artificial measure,
every poem, be it never so soulful, must have a definite number of feet
in each of its lines and a preconceived arrangement; yet, no one advances
the opinion that Scott was wasting his sense of poetry by casting it in the
form of octo-syllabic verse, or that Shakespeare had a difficulty in fitting
his thoughts to the measure of his sonnets or the blank verse of his plays.</p>

<p class="largecap">The most that can be advanced against those poetic conceits of the
kind condemned by Addison is that they appeal in a greater degree
to the eye than to the ear, and while we may be conscious of their artificial
nature we should also be catholic enough to admit their ingenuity, and
when they are sufficiently amusing to provoke laughter, or excite a smile,
they should not be denied the attributes of wit; for, after all, when we
free ourselves from the suspicion of affectation, do we not agree that the
chief end of wit is to amuse?</p>

<div class="highlines">

<p class="largecap">These remarks have been suggested
to the writer by his
discovering in one of his old scrap-books
a little collection of curiosities
of verse culled in Bookland
byways “oompty” years ago.
These do not consist of specimens
of the minor Greek poets’ eccentricities,
but in every case they
are examples of what Addison
would have unhesitatingly catalogued
as “false wit”; and yet,
not only are some of them
genuinely amusing and others
highly ingenious, but several display
a painstaking which almost
amounts to genius&mdash;if genius be “the capacity for taking pains.”</p>

<p class="largecap">We can, for example, appreciate the immense industry of the author
who set himself to compose a series, of verses in which the letter
“e” should be entirely omitted, and the painstaking of the author will
be yet further acknowledged when it is known that “e” is the most used
letter in the English alphabet, the relative proportion of its use being 120
times to j 4, k 8, g 17, and i 40.</p>

<p class="largecap">There are two such pieces among the writer’s literary curiosities and he
regards them as, perhaps, the most unique. The first one is as <span class="nowrap">follows&mdash;</span></p>

<h4>THE PAST.</h4>

<p class="largecap">Vast is the difference between
the Poets’ Patron of the past
and of the present period. Formerly
the noble was the encourager of the
lofty strains of inspiration, but nowadays
Moses is the Mæcenas of the
Muses. In times gone by the bard
was accustomed to write lays to laud
the lazy lordling, but now he sings
pæans to the paletot, and invests the
vest with the graceful trimmings of
fancy.</p>

<p>The poet has turned puffer instead
of parasite. Should another Pope
arise, he would sing the praises of
another Chesterfield; but instead of
being the Earl of that name, it would
be the wrapper he would take for the
subject of his lucubrations. The
following is a fair specimen of the
style of thing to which a new Pope
would most probably devote his
poetical <span class="nowrap">talents:&mdash;</span></p>

<h3>A WHITCOMB RILEY STORY</h3>

<p class="largecap">On the way to the office of his publishers one crisp autumn morning,
Mr. James Whitcomb Riley, the celebrated “Hoosier” poet of
America, who is almost as well known in England, met an unusually
large number of acquaintances who commented conventionally upon
the fine weather. This unremitting applause amused him. When
greeted at the office with “Nice day, Mr. Riley,” he smiled broadly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he agreed. “Yes, I’ve heard it very highly spoken of.”</p>

<h3>MARK TWAIN AND THE KEY</h3>

<p class="largecap">“Once when I was going out to visit some friends,” Mark Twain
is alleged to have said, in relating this one of the innumerable
“yarns” fathered on him, “I told George, my negro servant, to lock
the house and put the key under a certain stone near the steps. He
agreed to do so.</p>

<p>“It was late at night when I returned. I went to the stone under
which the key was supposed to have been hidden. It was gone. I
hunted around the premises for about fifteen minutes, but still no key.</p>

<p>“Finally I went to George’s house&mdash;he lived outside&mdash;and rapped,
vigorously upon the door. A black head, which I had no difficulty in
recognizing as George’s, popped out of an upstairs window.</p>

<p>“‘Where did you put that key, you black rascal?’ I roared.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, massa,’ answered George, ‘I found a better place for it.’”</p>

<p class="fig108"><span class="hide">T</span>he printing-house is notoriously the place for fun.
Every shop has its selection of funny men who are
ever ready to co-operate with the “devils” in
manufacturing mirth. And there are always the
“fossils,” who afford many an opportunity for a
hearty laugh at them, if not with them. Often
have I been amused with, the idiosyncrasies of
these typographical gray beards; their chief charm
being their colossal assurance as to their invariably
being right, and everybody else, who presumes
to differ from them, wrong. I recollect one of these ancient typesetters
(an old Scotsman) who used to be the butt of countless jokes in
the shop where he toiled so patiently. On one occasion he set up an
article from my pen, beginning, “Long before the introduction of Pears’
Soap”; and I am bothered if he didn’t turn the last two words into
“Pea Soup!” But the real fun of the matter was, that on his mistake
being pointed out, he blandly suggested our letting the words appear as
he had set them&mdash;“it wid dae jist as weel!”</p>

<p class="largecap">The printer does not seem to be deeply concerned about his future,
indeed, he has many a gay dig at that grave subject; as, for
<span class="nowrap">instance&mdash;</span></p>

the gifted poetess (authoress of “Floranthe,”
“The Lovelock of Montrose,”
“Moans of the Heartstrings,” etc.), and
exchanged portraits and your own poems
with her, you meet at last.</p>

<p class="caption just fsize80"><span class="padl2">You</span> are disappointed in her appearance
and find her about forty years
older than her picture; perhaps you,
too, have grown rather fat and seedy

<p class="largecap">The printer’s “devil,” by the
way, is a queer fish, and
there is a story about a certain
metropolitan imp that fits any of
the little sinners to a T. This
particular youngster had just received
his week’s wages, eleven
shillings, when he was heard to
soliloquize in these terms&mdash;“Let
me see. I’ll go the Coliseum to-night,
that’s a shilling; supper
with bottled beer, that’s eighteenpence;
’baccy for the week, a
shilling; beer ditto, two shillings;
theatre one night next week,
that’s one-and-six, and supper,
one-and-six; and I’ll buy that
swell walking stick, and that’ll
just leave sixpence to take home
to mother towards my week’s
board.” He must have been a
regular bad ’un, that.</p>

<p class="largecap">Another favourite medium
of printing-house fun is
found in adapting Gilbert’s
famous line and mourning that a “printer’s lot is not a happy one,” or
magnifying the annoyances from authors and editors with which
printers have to put up. In this connexion we find one printer relieving
his troubled soul <span class="nowrap">thus&mdash;</span></p>

</div><!--highlines-->

<p class="fsize90 blankbefore">Working for forty editors and scores
of authors, every one of whom is as sensitive<span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span>
as a sore thumb, and as lively and interesting
as a hornet, no wonder that
printers die young, and only pachydermatus,
grizzly, mulish specimens
get their share of life. The writer
wishes he could offer himself as an
awful example of the perils which
environ a man who meddles with cold
type. A thoroughly trained printer
should have had a stepmother, and
then a stepfather, and then have been
bound out to a tanner, and then have
married a scolding wife, and lived in a
smoky house, and have had a family of
babies who were afflicted with colic.
He should have added to all this discipline
a thorough knowledge of science,
art, law, language, theology, history
and biography. If, in addition, he
has a vicious looking countenance and
an amiable disposition, he may stand
some chance with these authors and
editors ; but the probabilities are, after
all, that they will worry him to
death.</p>

<p class="largecap">Then there is a certain freedom
about printers’ humour
which we don’t find elsewhere,
save among editors: but printers,
like editors, have ever been privileged
individuals, and we are told
that when the recording angel
observes a printer hold a bit of
bent brass rule between his
fingers, while he misses it with a
hammer, the trustworthy scribe
drops into a brown study, and pretends not to hear anything. Nor is it
logical to assume that a printer is a saint because he sets up a hymn-book.<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>

<p class="largecap">A former proprietor of the

a text from the Bible to be printed

by some mischance, the text got
lost, and Max tells us that the

“If anybody knew where that d&mdash;&mdash; text was?”</p>

<h3>HUMOURS OF ADVERTISING</h3>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<div class="highlines">

<p class="noindent fig119"><span class="hide">A</span>merica is the fatherland of Modern Advertising, and
Cousin Jonathan’s inherent taste for fun and unconventionality
has led him to adopt striking and often
humorous methods of appeal. Thus the Washington hotel-keeper who
issued a glowing announcement of the attractions of his establishment
would certainly lose nothing when he humorously added to his
advertisement in a Chicago paper: “Clergymen find this the best place
for rest, as book agents cannot climb the hill.”</p>

<p class="largecap">An enterprising Yankee who runs a hotel at Minnetonka, rejoicing in
the somewhat ominous name of <i>Mosquitos Rest</i>, sends forth an
announcement remarkable for the manner in which it mixes the sublime
with the commonplace. Here is a literal <span class="nowrap">extract&mdash;</span></p>

</div><!--highlines-->

<p class="fsize90 blankbefore">Delightful scenery. Clam bakes and ox tail soup every morning for breakfast.
No cyclones allowed to register. Dogs, children, and other pets not allowed on the
grass. Rates range from 3 dols. per day to 21 dols. per week. Excursions to Pike’s
Peak every afternoon. Newspaper publishers can all pay their board by promising
to give us a write-up when they get home. All kinds of baths on draft.</p>

<div class="highlines">

<p class="largecap blankbefore">Perhaps the most amusing descent from the sublime is to be found
in the advertisement of the proprietor of a building site in Wisconsin,
who offered his land for sale in these <span class="nowrap">terms&mdash;</span></p>

runs it pretty close. Here it is&mdash;“An
elegant stock of neat and
nobby shrouds, warranted to give
satisfaction to the most particular.”</p>

<p class="largecap blankbefore">As to humour arising from printers’ errors, a whole volume of such
amusing blunders might be collected, and the difficulty is to submit
one or two of the most mirth-provoking specimens. For instance, a
Boston clergyman asks for “a young man to take care of a span of horses
of a religious turn of mind,” while another person desires “a nurse in a
small gentleman’s family,” and a Texas man applies for a “Boss hand
over 5,000 sheep that can speak Spanish fluently.” In our home papers,
too, there are many such mirthful mistakes. For example, a notice in a
Welsh paper would lead one to believe the advertiser had reached
the height of “general utility,” and might be used for sleeping in, for
packing in, for hammering about, or for storing goods in, and that he
had been accustomed to that for seventeen years! Look you <span class="nowrap">now&mdash;</span></p>

this fashion&mdash;“Shop of Heaven-sent Luck,” “The
Shop of Celestial Principles,” “The Nine Felicities

in “The Honest Pen Shop of Li,” you have a guarantee that your
pens will follow the best policy, although the shopman’s name is just a
wee bit suspicious. John Chinaman shows his love of contrariness surely
when he advertises a charcoal shop as the “Fountain of Beauty,” a
coal depôt as “Heavenly Embroidery,” or an oil and wine establishment
as the “Neighbourhood of Chief Beauty,” and we can easily imagine the
fiendish chuckle with which the proprietor of an opium divan advertised
his shop as “The Thrice Righteous.”</p>

mileage tickets. The book had been the property

<p>“Are you on the <i>Courier-Journal</i>?” he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I’ve been a reporter there for several years.”</p>

<p>The conductor asked for some identification, which naturally the
passenger was unable to give.</p>

<p>“I have it,” said the conductor, suddenly remembering. “It just
happens that Henry Watterson, Editor of the <i>Courier-Journal</i>, is on the
Pullman ahead. If you’re all right he ought to be able to identify
you.”</p>

<p>At this the young man all but collapsed. However, there was nothing
to it but to take a chance. When they found Henry Watterson the
conductor handed out the mileage book, and, pointing to the young
man, asked if he was a reporter on the <i>Courier-Journal</i>.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed,” was the quick reply. “He is one of our best men.
How are you, Robert?”</p>

<p>Breathing a prayer of thanks, the young man returned to his seat
and resumed his journey without further trouble. Next morning, in
the dining wagon, he saw his friend and timidly approached him.</p>

<p>“Colonel Watterson,” he said fervently, “I can’t tell you how grateful
I am for what you did for me yesterday. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut. Don’t mention it,” returned his benefactor. “You
did every bit as much for me. I’m not Henry Watterson. I’m just
travelling on his pass.”</p>

<h3 class="highline">RULES FOR NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS</h3>

<div class="figleft">

</div>

<p class="noindent fig127"><span class="hide">S</span>upposing you wish to contribute to a public charity,
send your money to the Editor of a newspaper.
He must acknowledge the receipt of it, and so
you get your name and benevolence advertised
in the best part of the paper for nothing.</p>

<p>2. Another good method, if you are fond of
appearing before the public, is to request the Editor
to state that “the Richard Jones who, in our police
report of yesterday, was sentenced to Bridewell
for shoplifting, is not the Mr. Richard Jones, the respected chiropædist
of Sackville Street.”</p>

<p>3. If you are writing to a political newspaper, never mind about
writing on the two sides of the paper, as, depend upon it, it will be
a recommendation in your favour if the Editor sees you can write well on
<i>both sides</i>.</p>

<p>4. You need not be particular about writing legibly, as it stands
to reason, if the Editor cannot read your letter, that you will be spared
the mortification of reading in the next day’s Notices to Correspondents,
that “Philo-Justitiæ is an ass.”</p>

<p>5. It is usual in sending a statement, which impugns the character
of another person, to send your name and address with it; but, as in
matters of libel this is a very troublesome as well as a very expensive
plan, it is better to send anybody else’s card rather than your own.
By this means you avoid publicity, and have the double gratification
of annoying two persons at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span></p>

<p>6. Inserting your death one day, and contradicting it the next, is another
very cheap plan of advertising in a newspaper. Besides, you have
the advantage of learning in your lifetime what your friends think of
you after your death. This plan, however, will only answer once.</p>

<p>7. It is better, perhaps, not to send any poetry to a newspaper. We
never recollect an instance of the <i>Times</i> inserting “A Sonnet to a Sow,”
or “Lines to my Mary.”</p>

<p>8. Be careful of quotations, especially in a foreign language. If an
editor knows his own language well, it is as much as you have a right to
expect of him.</p>

<p>9. Never send anything to a newspaper “to be continued,” unless it
is a legacy or a dozen of port.</p>

<p>10. Never trouble yourself in calling to see the Editor of a newspaper.
It is a strange circumstance, but you might call a hundred times and
always find him “out.”</p>

<p class="blankbefore">A “gentleman” who wants employment “in any capacity not

write critiques,” etc. Obviously the advertiser considers literature
something a little above the work of a menial. We are, of course, obliged
for this admission. Nevertheless, we confess the above advertisement
has given us some doubts as to whether we shan’t find Jeames, with
his fine leg, on Grub-street pavement one of these days. We would
advise “W.” to go to a Dutchman, who advertises that he can supply
“literary hacks”; the literary livery stables are situated somewhere
up in Bloomsbury; and, no doubt, for a small sum he may be groomed
down any time after six, and, with the help of a farthing rushlight in a
dark lantern, find his way up Parnassus. We can tell him, however,
that it would be advisable to avoid the Temple of <span class="smcap">Fun</span>, as individuals

<p>These specimens may not be the best that can be quoted; I do not
suppose they are, and should indeed be audacious were I to submit them
as such. Addison’s assertion as to false wit will, no doubt, stand as firm
as ever in the minds of most people after reading these notes on “The
Poets at Play.” All that has been here attempted, and thus much perhaps
the indulgent reader will grant, has been to show that there may
be found in what the famous essayist would have us condemn as unworthy
many characteristics of wit, humour, and ingenuity; and not
only these, but examples of the patience and painstaking which are
near allied to “genius.”</p>

but there is no little enterprise and good humour
displayed in that business on this side the Atlantic.
In the street of a northern town one day, the writer was
presented with a handbill which will bear comparison
with many such transatlantic compositions. It was
issued by a tea merchant, whom we will refer to as
“Smith.” In great black letters was the heading, “Ananias Redivivus,”
then came the pointed queries, “Had Ananias any descendants? If
so, what became of them? Did they emigrate to Scotland?” From
the contents of the bill I take the following, which, I should state, was
“displayed” in a most effective <span class="nowrap">manner&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="fsize90">Smith says, no foolish buyers, no lying advertisers.</p>

<p class="fsize90">Why? Because, if there were no fools, it wouldn’t pay.</p>

<p class="fsize90">Thus the resetter is only responsible for some of the thieves; but the stupid, foolish
buyer is entirely responsible for all the lying advertisers; and by dealing with them
becomes a participator with them in their wickedness, which brought such disastrous
consequences upon Ananias.</p>

<p class="fsize90">But the way to know them is this&mdash;Use all the common-sense you have been blessed
with, and when you read such an advertisement as&mdash;“Best tea the world produces,
1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i> per lb.,” if you don’t say the advertiser is a common, bare-faced perverter of the
truth, a lineal descendant of Ananias, one with whom poor old Ananias would not
have had the ghost of a chance for boldness and audacity, then you have been blessed
with very little.</p>

<p class="fsize90">But did it pay Ananias? Will it pay his descendants?</p>

his uppers in a small town in Australia. To stave off starvation he
sought and found employment as a waiter in a fourth-class eating house.
One day a man who had known the artist in London dropped in and took
a seat at one of the tables. When May went to take his order mutual recognition
followed.</p>

<p>“Phil May!” the visitor exclaimed. “And compelled to work in a
hole like this!”</p>

that “dear Mr. Stubbs.”) The tall young man who on overhearing
the above praise, wetted his pocket-handkerchief, and removed an imaginary

impression that he was the fortunate man who had painted it, is some

<p class="largecap">I had hopes&mdash;I know that they have proved to
be unfounded, but I cannot admit that they
were unreasonable!&mdash;I <i>had</i> hopes that I should have
been able to avail myself of the privilege of free admission
conceded to exhibitors. Unfortunately, I do not
exhibit!</p>

<p>I sent three pictures! 1 (a pre-Raphaelite bit of nature), “Docks
and Marsh Mallows”; 2 (an attempt to depict a really unhackneyed
historical situation), “Charles the Second in the Oak”; 3 (a genre
painting), “The New Crinoline.”</p>

<p>If it were becoming (which it is not) I could say a good deal about
these works; but I forbear to do so. <i>They were all three rejected by
the Hanging Committee.</i></p>

<p>I have accordingly paid my shilling, and I mean to take it out in
criticism. The Academicians have exercised <i>their</i> rights; I shall use
mine. There will be plenty of hacks to fawn upon the imbecile canvas-spoilers,
the miserable, crass, cringing, dull, feeble, superannuated, impotent,
and abject Forty. Of those hacks I decline to be one. Honest
truth (uninfluenced by passion) is what the wretched dotards shall hear
from <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>I saw men prowling about (there was Mr. Thackeray, for instance,
as large as life, and a host of other “successful” men&mdash;<i>I</i> hate success!)
who had evidently made up their minds to be pleased with this, the
most disreputable Exhibition that ever degraded British Art. Let them.
Thoughts is free, as Mrs. Brown said at the play; <i>and so are mine</i>. It
is all very well to get a set of literary time-servers to hob and nob with
Academicians at the annual orgie which disgraces Trafalgar-square, and
on which hundreds of pounds are spent that ought to be devoted to the
development of talent such as that of&mdash;well, of some I <i>could</i> name; but
<i>I</i> was never invited to the so-called banquet. Banquet, indeed! I
would rather maintain my honest independence, though I had nothing
to eat but a polony&mdash;and this is sometimes the case! Look at young
Mr. Marcus Stone. I’ll be bound to say <i>he</i> never eats polonies&mdash;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>

Royal infants, and fifty of the Royal pets, from paroquet to Brazilian
monkey.</p>

calling. But your <i>Artists</i>? How goes it at the palace with them?</p>

<p><i>L. da Vinci.</i> Where else should sit the architects, engineers, philosophers,
poets of the nation&mdash;in whom all knowledge is orbed around
the Beautiful, and grows to Art?</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC FAILURES</h3>

<p>One of the advantages or disadvantages, as the case may be, of many
photographic portraits, is, that they fade away by degrees, and thus
keep pace with those fleeting impressions or feelings under which it is sometimes
usual for one to ask another for his or her miniature. It may be a
strong recommendation of cheap photography, that its pictures will last
as long as the ordinary run of small affections, and, indeed, a superior specimen
of the art may be warranted to retain its outline throughout a flirtation
of an entire month’s durability. We had our own portrait taken by the
cheap process a short time ago, when we received the above copy of the
state of the portrait through a period of an entire fortnight.</p>

<p>The three specimens shown above represent our portrait when recently
done; the same after it had been in existence a week, and the same after
the expiration of an entire fortnight. The following pathetic ballad was
appended to the specimens which we have given <span class="nowrap">above:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="largecap">To-day I was let sit up, tucked up in a quilt in
a arm-chare. I soon got tired o’ that, so I ast
Betty to get me a glass o’ ice-water to squench
my thirst, an’ when she was gone I cut an’
run, an’ went into Susan’s room to look at all
them fotografs of nice young men she’s got
there in a drawer.</p>

<p>The girls was all down in the parlour, ’cos
Miss Watson had come to call. Betty she came
a huntin’ me, but I hid in the closet behind a old
hoop-skirt. I come out when she went away, and had a real good time.
Some o’ them fotografs was written on the back, like this: “Conseated
fop!” “Oh, ain’t he sweet?” “He ast me, but I wouldn’t have him.”
“A perfect darling!” “What a mouth!” “Portrait of a donkey!”</p>

<p>I kep about two dozen o’ them I knew, to have some fun when I got
well. I shut the drawer so Sue wouldn’t notice they was took. I felt
as if I could not bare to go back to that nasty room, I was so tired of it,
an’ I thought I’d pass my time a playing I was a young lady. I found
a lot o’ little curls in the buro, wich I stuck on all around my forehead
with a bottle of mewsiledge, and then I seen some red stuff on a sawcer,
wich I rubbed onto my cheaks. When I was all fixed up I slid down
the bannisters plump against Miss Watson, wot was sayin’ good-bye to
my sisters. Such a hollerin’ as they made!</p>

<p>Miss Watson she turned me to the light, an’ sez she, as sweet as pie:</p>

<p>Susan she made a sign, but I didn’t know it.</p>

<p>“I found some red stuff in Sue’s drawer,” sez I, and she smiled kind
o’ hateful, and said:</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>My sister says she is an awful gossip, which will tell all over town

<p>Oh, my! when I get big enuff I’ll hope my mustaches won’t be waxed
like his’n! He’s in a store, an’ I got him to give me a nice cravat, an’
he ast me “Was my sisters well?” so I fished out his fotograf, and gave
it to him.</p>

<p>It was the one that had “Conseated Fop!” writ on the back. The
girls had drawed his mustaches out twict as long with a pencil, an’ made
him smile all acrost his face. He got as red as fire, an’ then he skowled
at me:</p>

<p>“Who did that, you little rascal!”</p>

<p>“I should say the spirits did it,” I said, as onest as a owl, an’ I went
away quick cause he looked mad.</p>

<p>The nex plaice I come to was a grocery store, where a nuther young
man lived. He had red hair an’ freckles, but he seemed to think hisself
a beauty. I said:</p>

<p>“Hello, Peters!”</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>“The same yourself, Master George. Do you like raisins? Help
yourself.”</p>

<p>Boys wot has three pretty sisters allers does get treted well, I notiss.
I took a big hanful of raisins an’ sot on the counter eating ’em, till all
at oncest, as if I jest thought of it, I took out his fotograf an’ squinted
at it, an sez:</p>

<p>“I do declare it looks like you.”</p>

<p>“Let me see it,” sez he.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t for a long time, then I gave it to him. The girls had made
freckles all over it. This was the one they wrote on its back, “He asked
me, but I wouldn’t have him.” They’d painted his hair as red as a
rooster’s comb. He got quite pale when he seen it clost.</p>

<p>I grabbed a nuther bunch o’ raisins an’ quietly disappeared. I tell
you he was rathy!</p>

<p>Mister Courtenay he was a lawyer, he’s got a offis on the square by the
cort-house. I knew him very well, ’cause he comes to our house offen.
He’s a awful queer-lookin’ chap, an’ so stuck up you’d think he was tryin’
to see if the moon was made o’ green cheese, like folks sez it is, the way
he keeps it in the air. He’s got a depe, depe voice way down in his boots.
My harte beat wen I got in there, I was that fritened; but I was bound to
see the fun out, so I ast him:</p>

<p>“Is the What is It on exabishun to-day?”</p>

<p>“Wot do you mean?” sez he, a lookin’ down on me.</p>

<p>“Sue said if I would come to Mister Courtenay’s offis I would see
wot this is the picture of,” sez I, givin’ him his own fotograf inskribed,
“The Wonderful What is It.”</p>

<p>It’s awful funny to see their faces wen they look at their own cards.</p>

<p>In about a minit he up with his foot, wich I dodged just in time. I
herd him muttering suthin’ ’bout “suing for scandal.” I think myself I
oughter arrest her for ’salt an’ battery, boxing my ears. I wisht he
would sue Sue, ’twould serve her right.</p>

<p>I’ll not get to bed fore midnight if I write enny more. I’m yawning
now like a dying fish. So, farewell my diry till the next time. I give
them cards all back fore dinner-time. There’ll be a row, I expect. I’ve
laughed myself almost to fits a thinkin’ of the feller wot I give “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page265">[265]</span>

he cried. They were teazin’ ma to let ’em give a party nex’ week wen I
got home to dinner. I don’t believe one of them young gentlemen will
come to it; the girls have give ’em all away. I don’t care tuppence.
Wot for do they take such libertys with my ears if they want me to be

<p class="fig291"><span class="hide">O</span>h, I don’t think as I ever did ’ave sich a ’ead-ache as
that arter we’d been to ’Ampton Court, as I do believe
a-settin’ on the grass ’ad struck to me, and cold weal
and ’am pie and cowcumber is wittles as along with
lobster salad and red currant tart you did ought to be
cautious ’ow you takes, and not ’urry thro’ it with all
that confusion, and you don’t know what you are a-takin’. And young
’Awkins as were attentive to me kep’ a-fillin’ up my plate and glass
every time as I turned my ’ead away a minit, as ’ave know’d ’im from
a child, and what with the confusion at the train a-gettin’ back, I were
that dizzy as I got into the wrong cab, as thro’ a mistake drove me
werry near to Nottin’-’ill afore I could make the stupid feller understand
as I wanted South Lambeth, and then to stand me out as I said
Bayswater.</p>

<p>It was past one in the mornin’ when I got ’ome, and ’ad to knock
Brown up, as were that savage, and all his own fault thro’ not a-lookin’
arter me at the Waterloo Station, thro’ ’avin’ got out at Wauxall, as
is certingly nearest, thro’ bein’ not five minits from our door, yet ’ow
was I to know as we’d got parted a-gettin’ into the train, and me that
dead beat as to fall asleep the werry moment as I were in the train, and
never opened my eyes till the man come for the ticket, and a nice trouble
I ’ad to find mine and every one in the carriage a-goin’ on at me as is
their larkin’ ways of a Sunday night.</p>

<p>Well, as I said afore never did I ’ave sich a ’eadache, as were downright
splittin’, and openin’ and a-shettin’ jest like water-works. I
’adn’t took no dinner, so was a-thinkin’ as I’d ’ave a early cup of tea,
and was a-settin’ quiet in my front parlour with the blinds drawed
down, a-thinkin’ as I might get a nap and be fresh for my tea.</p>

<p>I’d put my feet up on the sofy, as isn’t a thing as I do one time in
a thousand, and was a-droppin’ off, when of all the ’owlin’, gruntin’
and squeakin’ noises as ever you ’eard it broke out in our street. I
says, “they must be lunatics broke loose, a-makin’ free with them
hinstruments, as wouldn’t never make that noise left to theirselves
or used proper.”</p>

<p>I gets up and goes to the winder, and I see about four of them
German boys a-playin’ away on trombones, like mad, and one on ’em
a-tryin’ our gate.</p>

<p>So I knocks at the winder, and shakes my ’ead at ’im, he opens the
gate and comes in up to the winder as I opens, and says, “Go along.
I don’t want no more of your noise.”</p>

<p>He goes on with ’is gibberish rubbish, and I only says to ’im, “Get
out!” and shets down the winder.</p>

<p>Well, them young waggerbones kep’ on a-blowin’ and ’owlin’, like
any one in tortures till I couldn’t stand it no longer, so I opens the winder
ag’in, and ’olds up a jug of water, as the gal ’ad brought me up for
the plants, a-making believe to throw it over ’em, when one of them
’Opwoods as lives next door, comes out and tells ’em to go on playin’
and give ’em money.</p>

<p>The row as they kicked up, then, a-blowin’ right at me with them
big ’orns of theirn did so aggravate me that I took and chucked all
the water slap among ’em, and if one of them young wretches didn’t
pick up a big stone and shiver a pane of glass in my front parlour in a
jiffey.</p>

as proved to be the ’arth broom as ’angs with the kittle ’older, and out

<p>Well, them boys took to their ’eels, when they see me comin’ out

and sent a reg’lar wolley at me.</p>

<p>I ducked my ’ead in course, as they all went over right into old

<p>I never ’eard sich a crash, nor yet sich a roar as old ’Opwood give

<p>If all them ’Opwoods didn’t come out on the doorstep, and give me
their Billinsgate, for the old feller’s got two reg’lar brimstones of daughters,
besides ’is old wife as is a reg’lar old dragon of Wantage.</p>

<p>They all yells at me “’ow dare you set them boys on to destroy
our property.”</p>

<p>I says, “Me set the boys on? I was a-drivin’ them away with their

<p>“Oh, you old cat,” she says to me, a-gnashin’ ’er teeth, “’ow I
should like to tear your old wig off.”</p>

<p>I says, “No doubt, for I’m sure you wants one bad enough.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I says, “Go in Julia, and ’elp your ma skin the cat.”</p>

<p>Down the steps come the old woman, and says, “You audacious

<p>I’d got to my gate by that time. So I says to ’er, “Stand off you
wile filthy old wretch, don’t dare cross my doorstep!” and ’olds up
the ’arth broom at ’er.</p>

<p>Her two daughters, a-seein’ me threatenin’ ’er come up, and says,
“Ma, dear, come in.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I says, “Ma dear, do, or else the police may come by, and
you may get give in charge ag’in as you was the week afore last,” for
the old man ’ad been ’ad up for cruelty to animals twice.</p>

<p>They was all a-goin’ to fly out when a bobby come round the

a-goin’ off.</p>

<p>I says, “Oh, pray don’t ’urry, here is the police.”</p>

<p>I says to the perliceman, “’Ave you ’ad any one up lately hereabouts
for cruelty to animals”; and in they goes and bangs their doors;
and well they might, for that wicked old wretch had been destroyin’
of cats brutally, and they’d fined ’im for it; and I do believe as the
old woman did use to skin cats, for she wore a fur tippet in the winter
as was cats’ skins all over.</p>

<p>But law, ’ow singler things do come ’ome to parties sometimes,
to be sure; for it wasn’t but the next Sunday evenin’ arter, as I were

<p>I listens, and says to myself, “That’s some one in pain or I’m a
Dutchman.” So I goes closer to their wall and ’ears them groans and
smells burnin’.</p>

<p>So knowin’ as somethink were wrong I ’urries to their door and
knocks, but no one a-comin’, I says, “They’re all gone out,” and was
a-goin’ away, for I didn’t ’ear no more groans, but I smelt the burnin’;
so I says, “No doubt I shall only get insults for my pains, but I’ll try
and go in and see what’s amiss.” So I makes my way round to their
back door, as were only on the latch, and in I goes, and the smell
of burnin’ was downright sickenin’; I goes straight into the front
kitchen, and there was old ’Opwood a-layin’ in the fender a-roastin’
as ’ad fell out of ’is chair in a fit.</p>

<p>I ’auls ’im up, and never did see sich a sight as one side of ’is face
and all ’is neck and shoulder. The boy jest then come round with the
eight o’clock beer, so I ’ollers to ’im to run for a doctor, and I got ’old
’Opwood some’ow into ’is chair, as was quite insensible.</p>

<p>As luck would ’ave it, the doctor jest round the corner were at ’ome,
and come at once, and we got the old man’s burns dressed, as I
considers there’s nothink finer than whitin’, as the doctor agreed to.</p>

<p>If you’d seen that old Mother ’Opwood’s face and ’er daughters,
when they come in jest on ten and found me a-lookin’ arter that old
man, as we’d got up on to a sofy in the front parlour.</p>

<p>She begun to scream and holler at fust, and then said as I’d been
and done it.</p>

<p>I wasn’t the least put out with ’er, but only says to ’er daughters,
“Keep ’er quiet”; which they did by draggin’ on ’er up-stairs, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page279">[279]</span>
they kep’ ’er, and I must say, as they spoke werry ’andsome to me,
as stopped along with the old man till jest on twelve.</p>

<p>I didn’t think as the old man would ’ave lived thro’ it, but he did,
and ’ad his senses back, and able for to talk by the end of the week,
and told us as he remembered a-pitchin’ forard ag’in the bars a-tryin’
to get a light for ’is pipe.</p>

<p>He never will be the same man as he were, but it’s been a lesson
to ’im and to them, too, not to leave him alone, nor yet to be that insultin’
to a neighbour as they have been to me, a-doin’ everythink to
annoy me, and turnin’ me into every redicule as the ’uman ’art can
think on.</p>

<p>But they’ll never encourage them orgins and bands as they did use
to, and ’ave them inside their gardin’ to play when I’d sent them away,
and no doubt we should get on better for the future to come, but I’m
glad as we’re a-goin’ to move away, and all as I wants is to part friends,
for as to livin’ friendly next door to them I never could.</p>

<span class="i2">His namby-pamby wife.<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
